Hi! I am a first-year PhD student in the GLAMOR Lab at University of Southern California, where I am working with [Prof. Jesse Thomason](https://jessethomason.com/) on <b>language grounding in perception and, more broadly, the world</b>. 

Before this, I was a Research Intern at Microsoft Research, and briefly worked as an NLP Research Scientist at AI Foundation. I completed my Master's from the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, where I had the pleasure of working with [Prof. Yonatan Bisk](https://yonatanbisk.com/), [Prof. Louis-Philippe Morency](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~morency/) and [Prof. Florian Metze](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fmetze/interACT/Home.html).

My research interests lie in the area of multimodal machine learning and language grounding. My Master's research revolved around using vision to make speech recognition models more robust to missing/noisy audio signal. I have also recently worked on other NLP applications such as dialog, machine translation and computational social science.

Prior to CMU, I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, majoring in Mechanical Engineering, with a Minor degree in Computer Science.
