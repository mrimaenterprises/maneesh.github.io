Hi! I'm a second-year Master's student at the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. I am currently advised by [Prof. Florian Metze](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fmetze/interACT/Home.html).

My research interests lie in the area of multimodal machine learning. My recent work has revolved around using vision to make speech recognition models more robust to missing/noisy audio signal. I have also recently worked on other NLP applications such as dialog, machine translation and computational social science.

Prior to CMU, I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, majoring in Mechanical Engineering.
