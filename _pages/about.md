Hi! I'm an NLP Research Scientist at [AI Foundation](https://aifoundation.com/). Before this, I was a Master's student at the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by [Prof. Florian Metze](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fmetze/interACT/Home.html) and [Prof. Louis-Philippe Morency](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~morency/).

My research interests lie in the area of multimodal machine learning and language grounding. My recent work has revolved around using vision to make speech recognition models more robust to missing/noisy audio signal. I have also recently worked on other NLP applications such as dialog, machine translation and computational social science.

Prior to CMU, I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, majoring in Mechanical Engineering, with a Minor degree in Computer Science.
